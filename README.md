# Multi Person Activity Recognition using CSI (Wi-Fi Sensing)

Done for the completion of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree with Artificial Intelligence specs.

- models.ipynb: Contains the code for running and testing different models as well as evaluating them. 
- Preprocessing.ipynb: Contains code for accessing the raw CSI recordings and preprocessing them. 
- TestingArea.ipynb: Contains code for plotting the subcarriers for a single interaction. 

This project investigated two deep learning architectures: CSITime (Yadav et al., [2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608021004391)) as well as a compact, smaller version of XCeption (Chollet, [2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)).
