# Multi Person Activity Recognition using CSI (Wi-Fi Sensing)

This project investigated two deep learning architectures: CSITime (Yadav et al., [2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608021004391)) as well as a compact, smaller version of XCeption (Chollet, [2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)). Done for the completion of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree with Artificial Intelligence specs. 

This project used NumPy, matplotlib, Pandas, Tensorflow and sci-kit learn.
